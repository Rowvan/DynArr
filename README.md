# DynArr
This is a custom dynamic array. It was made to be able to dynamically allocate memory for variables on the heap using nodes. Later, I plan on adding more functionality like templating and stack allocation, if possible. 

# TemplDynArr
This is a class that is a copy of `DynArr` with templating.
